            <h3>Released June 4, 2015</h3>

            <p>

Tremonti colors his music with a message of hope and wraps it inside those hard-hitting, skin-pounding beats that take the listener from tumultuous storms to calm seas, but these contradictions in mood are intentional, crafted in a calculated and meticulous manner. Tremonti strives for perfection, to make the next creative endeavor better than the previous, and each one proves to be just that.
